SHELL MODE
----------

### Pipelines

A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators *|* or *|+++&+++*.
The format for a pipeline is: +
 +
    _command_ *|* _command2_ ... +
or: +
    _command_ *|+++&+++* _command2_ ...

The standard output of command is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2.
If *|+++&+++* is used, command's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to command2's standard input through the pipe.

### Redirections

Huginn shell supports following modes of redirection:

  - *<*   - redirect an existing file as a standard input to the process
  - *>*   - redirect standard output to file overwriting the file content
  - *>>*  - redirect standard output to file appending to the file content
  - *!>*  - redirect standard error only to file overwriting the file content
  - *!>>* - redirect standard error only to file appending to the file content
  - *>+++&+++*  - redirect both standard output and standard error to file overwriting the file content
  - *>>+++&+++* - redirect both standard output and standard error to file appending to the file content
  - *!+++&+++*  - redirect standard error as process's standard output

Note: *!+++&+++* redirection can be used only if an original standard output is also redirected.

### Command substitution

Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command name: +
 +
    _command_ param1 *$(*++++++_subcmd_ paramS1 paramS2 ...*)* param2 ...

*hgnsh* performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing
the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.

If the substitution appears within double quotes,
word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the results.

Command substitution can contain _Huginn expression_ which allows for arithmetic expansion.

### Brace expansion

Brace expansion lets you generate list of strings from _recursive-enumerating_ or _counting_ patterns, e.g.: +
 +
     _command_ pfx{AB,CD}sfx +
becomes: +
     _command_ pfxABsfx pfxABsfx

and: +
 +
     _command_ pfx{3..13..4}sfx +
becomes: +
     _command_ pfx3sfx pfx7sfx pfx11sfx
