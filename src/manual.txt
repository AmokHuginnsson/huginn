SHELL MODE
----------

### Pipelines

A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators *|* or *|+++&+++*.
The format for a pipeline is: +
 +
    _command_ *|* _command2_ ... +
or: +
    _command_ *|+++&+++* _command2_ ...

The standard output of command is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2.
If *|+++&+++* is used, command's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to command2's standard input through the pipe.

### Redirections

Huginn shell supports following modes of redirection:

  - *<*   - redirect an existing file as a standard input to the process
  - *>*   - redirect standard output to file overwriting the file content
  - *>>*  - redirect standard output to file appending to the file content
  - *!>*  - redirect standard error only to file overwriting the file content
  - *!>>* - redirect standard error only to file appending to the file content
  - *>+++&+++*  - redirect both standard output and standard error to file overwriting the file content
  - *>>+++&+++* - redirect both standard output and standard error to file appending to the file content
  - *!+++&+++*  - redirect standard error as process's standard output

Note: *!+++&+++* redirection can be used only if an original standard output is also redirected.
